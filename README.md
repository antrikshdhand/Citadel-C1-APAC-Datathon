# Citadel-C1-APAC-Datathon
APAC Datathon is an international data science competition hosted by Citadel and Correlation One. This repo holds my submission for Team 22.

Our report focused on discovering correlations between the states who invested the most in research-related drugs. For example, Californians and Texans both spend the most money on prescriptions related to a research program â€” why? The conclusion we reached is that it seems to be related to the number of General Care and Military Hospitals in those states. We used many statistical measures such as correlation matrices and also many unique data visualisation procedures such as choropleth maps to present our findings in a clear and concise way.

This is my first true start-to-finish data science report.
